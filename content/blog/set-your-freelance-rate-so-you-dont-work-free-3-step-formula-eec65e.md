# How to Set Your Freelance Rate So You Don't Work for Free (The 3-Step Formula)

Freelancing offers the flexibility to choose your projects, work environment, and schedule. However, one of the biggest challenges freelancers face is setting their rates. Many find themselves undercharging or even working for free. In this guide, we’ll break down a simple three-step formula to help you set your freelance rate effectively, ensuring that you get paid what you deserve.

## Steps

### Step 1: Calculate Your Costs

The first step in setting your freelance rate is to understand your costs. This includes both your business expenses and your personal living expenses. Here’s how to calculate it:

1. **List Your Monthly Expenses**: Write down all your monthly expenses, such as rent, utilities, groceries, insurance, and transportation. Let’s assume your total monthly expenses are as follows:
   - Rent: $1,200
   - Utilities: $200
   - Groceries: $300
   - Insurance: $150
   - Transportation: $100
   - Miscellaneous: $50

   Total Monthly Expenses:
   
   **Total expenses calculation:**
   Total expenses = $1,200 + $200 + $300 + $150 + $100 + $50 = $2,000

2. **Business Expenses**: Next, consider your business costs, which may include software subscriptions, website hosting, marketing expenses, and supplies. Let’s say your business expenses total $500 per month.

   Total Monthly Costs:
   
   **Total costs calculation:**
   Total costs = Total expenses + Business expenses = $2,000 + $500 = $2,500

### Step 2: Determine Your Desired Income

Now that you have a clear picture of your costs, it's time to determine how much you want to earn. This will depend on your lifestyle and financial goals. For this example, let’s say you want to earn $4,000 per month.

### Step 3: Set Your Hourly Rate

To find your hourly rate, you need to consider how many billable hours you can realistically work in a month. Let’s assume you plan to work 20 hours a week, which totals:

**Billable hours per month:**
Hours per month = 20 hours per week × 4 weeks = 80 hours

To find your required hourly rate, use the following formula:

**Hourly rate formula:**
Hourly Rate = (Total costs + Desired income) ÷ Hours per month

Plugging in our numbers:

**Hourly rate calculation:**
Hourly Rate = ($2,500 + $4,000) ÷ 80 = $6,500 ÷ 80 = $81.25 per hour

Now, you know that to cover your costs and achieve your desired income, you need to charge approximately $81.25 per hour.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Underestimating Costs**: Many freelancers overlook hidden costs like taxes, health insurance, or retirement savings. Make sure you include these in your calculations.

2. **Not Accounting for Non-Billable Hours**: Freelancers often spend time on tasks that aren't directly billable, such as marketing, client communication, and administrative work. Ensure your calculations consider these hours.

3. **Setting Rates Based on Competitors**: While it's good to be aware of market rates, don't set your rates based solely on what others are charging. Your unique skills and circumstances matter.

4. **Failing to Adjust Rates Over Time**: As you gain experience and expertise, your rates should reflect that growth. Regularly review and adjust your rates as necessary.

## Example

Let’s run through a quick example based on the calculations we've done.

**Scenario**: Sarah is a freelance graphic designer who wants to set her rates. Here’s her breakdown:

1. **Monthly Living Expenses**: 
   - Rent: $1,500
   - Utilities: $250
   - Groceries: $400
   - Insurance: $200
   - Transportation: $150
   - Miscellaneous: $100
   - **Total Living Expenses**: 
   **Total expenses calculation:**
   Total expenses = $1,500 + $250 + $400 + $200 + $150 + $100 = $2,600

2. **Business Expenses**: $600 (software, marketing, etc.)
  
   **Total Monthly Costs**:
   
   **Total costs calculation:**
   Total costs = Total expenses + Business expenses = $2,600 + $600 = $3,200

3. **Desired Income**: $5,000

4. **Billable Hours**: 80 hours/month

5. **Hourly Rate Calculation**:
   **Hourly rate calculation:**
   Hourly Rate = ($3,200 + $5,000) ÷ 80 = $8,200 ÷ 80 = $102.50 per hour

Sarah should charge $102.50 per hour to cover her costs and meet her income goals.
