# Understanding How Mortgage Payments Change Based on Interest Rate, Term, and Down Payment

When considering a mortgage, many factors come into play that can significantly affect your monthly payments. In this guide, we'll explore how interest rates, loan terms, and down payments influence your mortgage payments, helping you make informed financial decisions.

## Background

A mortgage is a loan taken out to buy property, where the property itself serves as collateral. The monthly payments consist of principal and interest. Understanding how different variables impact your payments can save you money in the long run.

### Key Terms:
- **Principal**: The amount borrowed.
- **Interest Rate**: The percentage charged on the principal, determining the cost of borrowing.
- **Loan Term**: The length of time over which you'll repay the loan, typically in years (e.g., 15 or 30 years).

## Method
To calculate monthly mortgage payments, you can use online calculators or speak with your lender. The payment depends on your loan amount, interest rate, and loan term.
### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's say you're considering a home costing $300,000 with a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 4%.

For a $300,000 home with a 20% down payment ($60,000), your loan amount would be $240,000. With a 30-year mortgage at 4% interest, your monthly payment would be approximately $1,155.

So, your monthly mortgage payment will be approximately **$1,155.12**.

## Examples

### Example 1: Changing the Interest Rate
If the interest rate increases to 5%, let's see how it affects your monthly payment:

**Interest rate conversion:** For a 5% interest rate, convert to monthly decimal: 0.05 (annual rate) ÷ 12 (months) = 0.00417 monthly rate.
