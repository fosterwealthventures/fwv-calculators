# Understanding How Mortgage Payments Change Based on Interest Rate, Term, and Down Payment

When considering a mortgage, many factors come into play that can significantly affect your monthly payments. In this guide, we'll explore how interest rates, loan terms, and down payments influence your mortgage payments, helping you make informed financial decisions.

## Background

A mortgage is a loan taken out to buy property, where the property itself serves as collateral. The monthly payments consist of principal and interest. Understanding how different variables impact your payments can save you money in the long run.

### Key Terms:
- **Principal**: The amount borrowed.
- **Interest Rate**: The percentage charged on the principal, determining the cost of borrowing.
- **Loan Term**: The length of time over which you'll repay the loan, typically in years (e.g., 15 or 30 years).

## Method

To calculate monthly mortgage payments, we can use the mortgage payment formula:

$$
M = P \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
$$

Where:
- \(M\) = monthly payment
- \(P\) = principal (loan amount)
- \(r\) = monthly interest rate (annual rate divided by 12)
- \(n\) = number of payments (loan term in months)

### Step-by-Step Calculation

Let's say you're considering a home costing $300,000 with a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 4%.

1. **Calculate the Down Payment:**
   $$ 
   Down\ Payment = Home\ Price \times Down\ Payment\ Percentage 
   $$ 
   $$ 
   Down\ Payment = 300,000 \times 0.20 = 60,000
   $$

2. **Calculate the Loan Amount (Principal):**
   $$ 
   P = Home\ Price - Down\ Payment 
   $$ 
   $$ 
   P = 300,000 - 60,000 = 240,000 
   $$

3. **Convert the Annual Interest Rate to Monthly:**
   $$ 
   r = \frac{Annual\ Interest\ Rate}{12} 
   $$ 
   $$ 
   r = \frac{0.04}{12} = 0.003333 
   $$

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Payments:**
   $$ 
   n = Loan\ Term \times 12 
   $$ 
   $$ 
   n = 30 \times 12 = 360 
   $$

5. **Plug Values into the Mortgage Formula:**
   $$ 
   M = 240,000 \frac{0.003333(1 + 0.003333)^{360}}{(1 + 0.003333)^{360} - 1} 
   $$

6. **Calculate the Result:**
   - First, calculate \( (1 + r)^{n} \):
   $$ 
   (1 + 0.003333)^{360} \approx 3.243 
   $$
   - Now substitute this back into the formula:
   $$ 
   M = 240,000 \frac{0.003333 \times 3.243}{3.243 - 1} 
   $$ 
   $$ 
   M \approx 240,000 \frac{0.01081}{2.243} \approx 240,000 \times 0.00482 \approx 1,155.12 
   $$ 

So, your monthly mortgage payment will be approximately **$1,155.12**.

## Examples

### Example 1: Changing the Interest Rate
If the interest rate increases to 5%, let's see how it affects your monthly payment:

1. New \( r \) value:
   $$ 
   r = \frac{0.05}{
