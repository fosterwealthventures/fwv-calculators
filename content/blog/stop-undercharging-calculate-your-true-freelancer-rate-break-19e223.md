# Stop Undercharging: How to Calculate Your True Freelancer Rate & Break-Even Point

As a freelancer, determining your true rate and understanding your break-even point are crucial for your financial health. Many freelancers fall into the trap of undercharging for their services, which can lead to burnout and financial stress. This guide will help you calculate your ideal freelancer rate and break-even point, ensuring you charge what you're worth.

## 7 Key Points

1. **Understand Your Costs**: Before you can calculate your rate, you need to know what your expenses are. This includes both fixed and variable costs.

2. **Calculate Your Desired Salary**: Determine how much money you want to earn annually. This is often referred to as your target income.

3. **Determine Billable Hours**: Knowing how many hours you can realistically bill is essential. This will affect your hourly rate.

4. **Incorporate Taxes**: Don’t forget to factor in taxes. As a freelancer, you’re responsible for covering your own tax obligations.

5. **Calculate Your Break-Even Point**: Your break-even point helps you understand how much you need to earn to cover your costs.

6. **Use Calculators for Accuracy**: Utilize tools like the [Freelance Rate Calculator](/calculators) to assist in your calculations.

7. **Regularly Reassess Your Rate**: Your costs and market conditions may change, so reassessing your rate regularly is vital.

## Examples

Let's walk through an example to calculate your true freelancer rate and break-even point.

### Step 1: Understand Your Costs

Suppose you have the following monthly expenses:

- Rent: $1,000
- Utilities: $200
- Software Subscriptions: $100
- Internet: $100
- Professional Development: $50
- Marketing: $150
- Miscellaneous: $100

**Total monthly costs:** Add up all your business and living expenses: $1,000 (rent) + $200 (utilities) + $100 (software) + $100 (internet) + $50 (professional development) + $150 (marketing) + $100 (miscellaneous) = $1,700 total.

### Step 2: Calculate Your Desired Salary

**Monthly desired income:** If you want to earn $60,000 per year, divide by 12 months: $60,000 ÷ 12 = $5,000 per month.

### Step 3: Determine Billable Hours

**Total working hours per year:** If you work 40 hours per week and take 4 weeks of vacation: 40 hours/week × (52 weeks - 4 vacation weeks) = 40 × 48 = 1,920 hours per year.

**Billable hours:** If you can only bill 75% of your working time (accounting for admin work, marketing, etc.): 1,920 total hours × 0.75 = 1,440 billable hours per year.

### Step 4: Calculate Your True Freelancer Rate

Now, to find your hourly rate, add your total monthly costs to your desired income and divide by your billable hours.

**Total monthly income needed:** Add your business costs to your desired personal income: $1,700 (costs) + $5,000 (desired income) = $6,700 total needed per month.

**Hourly rate:** Divide your total monthly income needed by your monthly billable hours (annual billable hours ÷ 12): $6,700 ÷ (1,440 ÷ 12) = $6,700 ÷ 360 = approximately $18.61 per hour.

### Step 5: Calculate Your Break-Even Point

**Break-even hours:** Divide your monthly costs by your hourly rate to find out how many hours you need to work to break even: $1,700 (costs) ÷ $18.61 (hourly rate) ≈ 91.3 hours per month.

**What this means:** You need to work about 92 billable hours per month just to cover your basic costs, before earning any profit.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring Taxes**: Many freelancers forget to factor in taxes, which can significantly affect income. Always set aside approximately 25-30% for taxes.

2. **Underestimating Expenses**: Be thorough in listing all your costs. Small expenses can add up quickly.

3. **Not Adjusting for Time Off**: Ensure you account for holidays and time off in your calculations.

4. **Failing to Reassess Rates**: Regularly check your rates against market trends and your evolving needs.

## Actionable Next Steps

1. Gather your monthly expenses and list them as we did in Step 1.
2. Decide on your desired annual income.
3. Use the [Freelance Rate Calculator](/calculators) to streamline your calculations.
4. Regularly review your expenses, desired income, and billable hours at least every six months.

## FAQs

### How often should I reassess my freelancer rate?

It’s advisable to reassess your freelance rate every 6-12 months or whenever you experience significant changes in your expenses or target salary.

### What if my calculated rate seems too high for the market?

If your rate is higher than the market average, consider the value you bring to your clients. If you provide specialized skills or exceptional service, you can justify a higher rate. Research competitors to find a balance.

### Do I need to account for my non-billable hours?

Yes! Non-billable hours (like marketing, administration, and training) should be factored into your overall business strategy. These hours contribute to your business but won’t directly earn you money.
