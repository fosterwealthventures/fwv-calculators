# Restaurant Owners: Calculating Your Team's Tip Pool and Its Impact on Your True Labor Cost

As a restaurant owner, understanding the financial dynamics of your business is crucial not only for profitability but also for maintaining a harmonious work environment. One key area that often confuses operators is the calculation of the tip pool and its impact on true labor costs. This guide will walk you through the process of calculating your team's tip pool systematically and explain how it affects your overall labor costs. 

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine Total Tips Collected

**Total tips collected:** For this example, your restaurant collected $2,000 in tips during one week.

### Step 2: Identify the Eligible Employees

Next, you need to identify which employees will be sharing the tip pool. Typically, this includes servers, bartenders, and sometimes kitchen staff. Let’s assume you have the following employees eligible for tips:

- 5 Servers
- 2 Bartenders
- 1 Host

That gives you a total of 8 eligible employees.

### Step 3: Calculate Individual Shares

**Tip per employee:** Simply divide the total tips collected by the number of eligible employees: $2,000 ÷ 8 = $250 per person.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Labor Costs

Now, you need to calculate your total labor costs, which include not only wages but also the distributed tips. Let’s assume each server earns $500 a week, bartenders earn $600, and the host earns $400. 

**Total wages calculation:** Add up all employee wages: (5 servers × $500) + (2 bartenders × $600) + (1 host × $400) = $2,500 + $1,200 + $400 = $4,100.

**Total labor costs:** Add your employee wages and the tips collected: $4,100 (wages) + $2,000 (tips) = $6,100 total labor cost.

### Step 5: Calculate True Labor Cost as a Percentage of Sales

To assess the true labor cost, you need to compare it against your total sales for the week. Let’s say your total sales for that week are $25,000.

**Labor cost percentage:** Divide your total labor costs by your total sales and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: ($6,100 ÷ $25,000) × 100 = 24.4% of your sales go to labor costs.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Inaccurate Tip Collection Reporting**: Ensure that all tips are accurately reported. Missing even a small amount can skew your calculations.

2. **Neglecting to Include All Eligible Employees**: Be thorough in identifying who should receive a share of the tips. Failing to include all eligible staff can lead to discontent.

3. **Forgetting to Factor in Labor Taxes**: Remember that labor costs also include employer taxes. Make sure to factor these into your total labor costs.

4. **Using Average Tips**: It’s important to use actual figures rather than estimating. This can lead to over- or under-budgeting.

## Example

Let’s apply the above calculations with real numbers.

- **Total Tips Collected**: $2,000
- **Eligible Employees**: 8 (5 Servers, 2 Bartenders, 1 Host)
- **Wages**: 
  - Servers: 5 x $500 = $2,500
  - Bartenders: 2 x $600 = $1,200
  - Host: 1 x $400 = $400
- **Total Wages**: $4,100
- **Total Sales**: $25,000

Now, calculating:

**Tip per employee:** $2,000 (total tips) ÷ 8 (eligible employees) = $250 per person.

**Total labor costs:** $4,100 (wages) + $2,000 (tips) = $6,100 total.

**Labor cost percentage:** ($6,100 ÷ $25,000) × 100 = 24.4% of your sales go toward labor costs.

This means that 24.4% of your sales are going towards labor costs, including tips. 

## FAQs

**Q1: How often should I calculate my team's tip pool?**  
A1: It's best to calculate your tip pool weekly or bi-weekly, depending on how often you pay your employees. This ensures that everyone is fairly compensated in a timely manner.

**Q2: Can I use tips to cover employee wages?**  
A2: While tips can supplement wages, they cannot replace the minimum wage requirements. Ensure that all employees earn at least the minimum wage regardless of tips.

**Q3: How can I track tips more accurately?**  
A3: Implement a tip tracking system, either through a point-of-sale system or manually, to ensure all tips are reported and distributed accurately.

**Q4: What if my tip pool fluctuates significantly?**  
A4: It is advisable to set a baseline or average for tips over a few weeks to avoid large fluctuations that could impact your labor budgeting.
