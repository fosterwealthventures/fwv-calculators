# Break-Even Point: How to Calculate (Formula + Example)

**TL;DR:** The break-even point tells you **how many units** you must sell (or how much revenue to generate) to cover **all** costs—no profit, no loss.

- **Formula (units):** `Break-even units = Fixed costs ÷ (Price − Variable cost per unit)`
- **Formula (revenue):** `Break-even revenue = Break-even units × Price`

## What is the break-even point?

The **break-even point (BEP)** is where **total revenue equals total costs**—you’ve covered fixed and variable costs, and profit is **zero**. Past this point, additional sales contribute to profit.

### Key terms
- **Fixed costs:** Expenses that don’t change with units sold (e.g., rent, salaries, software).
- **Variable cost per unit:** Cost that scales with each unit (materials, packaging, transaction fees).
- **Price per unit:** What you charge each customer per unit.
