        <div>
          <H2>Mistake #1 — Mixing time bases (monthly vs yearly)</H2>
          <p>
            The most common error is entering revenue per year while expenses are
            per month (or vice-versa). The totals look “about right,” but the math
            is off by 12×. Mortgage, break-even, ROI, and employee cost
            calculations all suffer from this.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Pick a single period for <em>all</em> inputs—either
            monthly or yearly—and convert everything to that base before running the
            numbers. Many fields list the expected period; when in doubt, convert
            explicitly.
          </p>
          <List>
            <li>Monthly ↔ Yearly: multiply or divide by 12.</li>
            <li>Weekly ↔ Monthly: multiply or divide by ~4.33.</li>
            <li>Daily ↔ Monthly: multiply or divide by 30 (or workdays used).</li>
          </List>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>Mistake #2 — Percent vs decimal (and per-period rates)</H2>
          <p>
            Entering <code>7</code> when a field expects <code>0.07</code>, or using an
            annual rate in a monthly column, skews interest, ROI, and discounting.
            Labels like APR/APY and “per period” are easy to skip when moving fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Confirm whether a field expects a percentage or a
            decimal and the <em>rate period</em>. If a model is monthly, use the
            monthly rate (APR ÷ 12) unless it explicitly compounds differently.
          </p>
          <List>
            <li>Percent → decimal: divide by 100 (7% → 0.07).</li>
            <li>Annual → monthly rate: APR ÷ 12 (simple assumption).</li>
            <li>Check compounding notes if precision matters.</li>
          </List>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>Mistake #3 — Ignoring “small” costs and fees</H2>
          <p>
            Payment processor fees, employer taxes/benefits, sales tax, shipping,
            maintenance, and one-time setup costs look tiny alone but compound into
            real money. Leaving them out inflates margins and ROI.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> List every recurring and one-time cost, then add them
            to your model. For employee cost, include payroll taxes, benefits, and
            tools. For products, include freight, packaging, and returns. For SaaS,
            include tiers after growth.
          </p>
          <List>
            <li>Processors: % + fixed fee per transaction.</li>
            <li>Employer burden: taxes, healthcare, PTO.</li>
            <li>“Hidden” ops: shipping, chargebacks, refunds, support.</li>
          </List>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>Mistake #4 — No sensitivity or scenario testing</H2>
          <p>
            Using best-case inputs (perfect conversion, zero churn, stable prices)
            makes any plan look great. Real life wanders. If one assumption moves,
            your result might flip from profit to loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Stress-test the top drivers. Re-run the model at
            −10% and +10–20% for the few inputs that move the outcome most (price,
            conversion, utilization, rate). Save scenarios—Best / Base / Worst—and
            decide with the full picture.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>Mistake #5 — Comparing apples to oranges (no annualization)</H2>
          <p>
            A 6-month project with 8% total return can beat a 2-year project with
            12% total return once you account for time. Comparing <em>totals</em> only
            is misleading.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Use <em>annualized ROI</em> (or NPV/IRR when relevant)
            to make durations comparable. When you must keep it simple, at least
            note the time horizon next to the result.
          </p>
