        <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Most bad outputs come from a few repeat offenders: mismatched time
          frames, ignoring fees/taxes, mixing APR with APY, using averages
          when you need margins, and rounding/omitting details that matter.
          Fix those and your calculations line up with the bank statement.

        <h2>Mistake #1 ‚Äî Comparing different time frames</h2>
        <p>
          A 10% gain over 3 months is not directly comparable to 10% over 3 years.
          Using total ROI alone makes short periods look artificially attractive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> convert to a common basis (per year). Use{" "}
          <em>Annualized ROI</em> for investments, or make sure all inputs share the
          same units (months vs. years) before comparing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
          Example: ROI 15% in 2 years ‚Üí Annualized ‚âà (1.15)^(1/2) ‚àí 1 ‚âà 7.25%/yr.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mistake #2 ‚Äî Ignoring fees and taxes</h2>
        <p>
          Commissions, closing costs, PMI, card fees, or capital-gains taxes can
          flip a ‚Äúgreat‚Äù result into just okay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> include one-time and recurring fees in your inputs.
          For taxes, model a realistic rate so you‚Äôre not surprised later.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mortgage: taxes/insurance/PMI belong in the payment picture.</li>
          <li>Investing: use net proceeds (after fees) in ROI.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mistake #3 ‚Äî Mixing APR and APY (and compounding)</h2>
        <p>
          APR is the quoted yearly rate; APY includes compounding. Using APR in a
          compounding formula without setting the frequency (or vice versa) produces
          wrong growth/payoff numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> match the calculator‚Äôs compounding to reality
          (annual, quarterly, monthly, daily) ‚Äî or select ‚Äúsimple‚Äù when there‚Äôs
          no compounding.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
          Example: $5,000 at 6% for 3 years ‚Üí simple interest $900; yearly
          compounding ‚âà $955 interest.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mistake #4 ‚Äî Using averages when you need margins</h2>
        <p>
          Break-even and pricing rely on <em>contribution margin</em>, not average
          revenue. Mixing products without weighting, or using ‚Äúaverage cost‚Äù when
          variable cost per unit is what matters, shifts break-even incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> use <em>Price ‚àí Variable Cost</em> for margin per unit
          and weight by mix. Keep fixed costs separate.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
          Example: BE Units = Fixed Costs √∑ (Price ‚àí Variable Cost).
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Mistake #5 ‚Äî Rounding and omissions that snowball</h2>
        <p>
          Trimming cents, leaving out small monthly costs, or forgetting an occasional
          fee can be fine once ‚Äî but across 360 payments or 12 months it becomes
          real money.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix:</strong> enter exact values; use rounding <em>after</em> you
          review totals. Add recurring costs in their native frequency and let the
          calculator convert.
        </p>

        <h2>Mini Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Are all time inputs in the same units (months vs. years)?</li>
          <li>Did you include one-time and recurring fees/taxes?</li>
          <li>Does compounding frequency match the product?</li>
          <li>For pricing/BE: did you use <em>variable</em> cost, not average?</li>
          <li>Any rounding/edge cases that need a sanity check?</li>
        </ul>
