      <Section>
        <div>
          <H2>What this calculator does (Free)</H2>
          <p>
            The Free version helps you turn a messy shared bill into a clear per-person amount for up to <b>4 people</b>.
            Enter the bill total, apply any discount, choose how tax is calculated, set a tip, and choose whether that tip
            is on the discounted or original subtotal. The app shows a clean final total and an even split so nobody is
            guessing or overpaying.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>How to use it</H2>
          <p>
            Start by entering the Bill Amount before tax. Add the Number of People. If you have a coupon or promo code,
            choose percent or fixed amount in Discount. Set how tax should apply—most places tax the discounted subtotal.
            Then enter your Tip Percentage and choose whether the tip should be based on the discounted or the original
            subtotal (some groups tip on the pre-discount amount to reflect service).
          </p>
          <p>
            The calculator recomputes live: you’ll see the discounted subtotal, tax, tip, and final total. It divides that
            by the number of people for a fair per-person contribution. Example: $80 bill, 10% discount, 8% tax, 18% tip
            on the pre-discount subtotal, split four ways—watch how each choice changes the share.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>When to upgrade (Plus)</H2>
          <p>
            For uneven orders, shared appetizers, groups of <b>5+</b>, or if you want exports, use
            <span className="ml-2 rounded-md border px-1.5 py-0.5 text-[11px]">Plus</span> and switch to
            <b> Split by Order</b>. It allocates tax and tip proportionally to each person’s items.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <H2>Pitfalls & tips</H2>
          <p>
            Common mistakes: tipping on the wrong base, applying tax before removing the discount, or adding a tip when a
            service charge already applies. If there’s auto-gratuity, set Tip to 0% (or only the extra you want).
